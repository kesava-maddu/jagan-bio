        Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), also known mononymously as Jagan, is an Indian politician, currently serving as the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Pulivendula Assembly constituency in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative assembly. He served as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 2019 to 2024, and is the current president of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy.
        Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009.[12] After his father's death due to a helicopter crash in 2009, he started an Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) across the state.[13] He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.
        On 27 May 2012, Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on embezzlement charges. CBI summoned Reddy for allegedly amassing huge assets through illegal means by using his father's office, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, when he was the chief minister. CBI and ED has also summoned 58 companies of investing in Reddy's businesses, for the favours they allegedly received in the form of mining leases, allotments of projects.[15] His judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded.

        Reddy's father Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, popularly known as YSR, was a two-time chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. He started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa district.[38] In 2009, he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa Lok Sabha constituency.[38]

Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour), as promised earlier, to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter.

        In the 2019 National and State election held in April and May 2019, YSR Congress Party swept the polls and won 151 of the total 175 assembly seats and 22 of the 25 Lok Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh. He took oath as the Chief Minister on 30 May 2019.[52] His chief ministership has been marked by a slew of welfare schemes such as Jagananna Amma Vodi, Navaratnalu.[53] Jagananna Amma Vodi provides financial assistance for mothers or guardians from the Below Poverty Line, to educate their children.[54][55] Navaratnalu is a collection of nine welfare schemes covering farmers, women, medical and health, education and Special Category Status.[53] He scrapped the plans for a new capital at Amaravati, proposed by the former TDP government, and has proposed three different capitals for the judicial, administrative and legislative branches at Kurnool, Amaravati and Visakhapatnam respectively.[56] The proposal resulted in widespread protests by the farmers of Amaravati.[57] The Andhra Pradesh High Court in a March 2022 ruling directed the Government of Andhra Pradesh to continue developing Amaravati and adjudicated that the government "lacked the competence to make any legislation for shifting, bifurcating or trifurcating the capital".[58]

As of April 2023, it was reported by the Association for Democratic Reforms that he was the richest Chief Minister in India,
